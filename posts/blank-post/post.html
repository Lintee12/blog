        <h1>Post Title</h1>
        <author>By: Evan</author>
        <p>
          This is going to be a really long paragraph that im just making up as
          i type so thats why it makes no sense... who knows it might even have
          some spelling mistakes... take a look for youreself and find out LMAO
          see what i did there i made a spelling mistake as i was talking about
          mistakes and i totally didnt do that on accident and pretend like a
          did in on purpose!!!
        </p>
        <h2>
          This is a sub title for something else happening in the article!
        </h2>
        <p>
          Hello this is going to be another long meaningless paragraph im just
          now realizing that ima actually not that bad at typing without making
          mistakes wow who knew, by the way i have a spell checker installed in
          vscode so i can see spelling mistakes i really recommend this plugin
          if youre gonna be doing anything like im doing right now...
        </p>
        <h2>I forgot to wrap th article in the "article" tag!</h2>
        <p>
